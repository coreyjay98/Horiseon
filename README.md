# Brief
I was tasked with making this website more accessible and to ensure that the code behind it was semantically structured and adhered to industry standards. 

## Solutions
I will highlight some of the changes I made to the code in order to fulfill the task 

-Commented the CSS to ensure that the client could easily find any aspect when viewing the code
-Ensured that the links on the page worked as intended and the Images loaded in correctly
-Added alt tags to make every image more accessible (Screen Readers)
-Ensured that the HTML and CSS followed a good semantic structure and matched together to make the code easier to read for the client 
-Improved the formatting of the code to make it clearer to read
